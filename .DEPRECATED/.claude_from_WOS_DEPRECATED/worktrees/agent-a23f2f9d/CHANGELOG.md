## [0.0.23] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- **Notification creation on reply:** When a post is created, all subscribers to the thread (except the post author) receive a `Notification` record with `event_type=forum_reply`. Notification creation failures are caught and logged without blocking post creation.
- **Notification endpoints:** PUT `/api/v1/notifications/<id>/read` and PUT `/api/v1/notifications/read-all` for marking notifications read individually or in bulk.
- **Subscription status endpoint:** GET `/api/v1/forum/threads/<id>/subscription` returns `{"subscribed": true/false}` for the authenticated user.
- **Discussion link serialization:** `discussion_thread_id` and `discussion_thread_slug` included in public GET responses for both news articles and wiki pages.
- **Admin UI — discussion thread linking:** News and wiki management pages include a discussion thread ID field with Link and Unlink buttons to connect/disconnect forum threads.
- **Public UI — discussion link:** News article detail and wiki page views show a "Join Discussion" link when a discussion thread is linked.
- **Subscribe bar in forum threads:** Thread pages show Subscribe/Unsubscribe button that checks current subscription status and toggles via API.
- **Notification badge in nav:** Navigation bar shows unread notification count for authenticated users.
- **Moderation metrics dashboard:** Management forum page includes a moderation metrics card (open reports, hidden posts, locked threads) and a recent open reports table, visible to moderators and admins.
- **Migration 023:** `notifications` table created with `user_id`, `event_type`, `target_type`, `target_id`, `message`, `is_read`, `created_at`, `read_at` columns and appropriate indices.

### Fixed

- **Postman collection:** Replaced all `{{base_url}}` variable references with `{{baseUrl}}` to match environment file definitions. Added Mark Notification Read, Mark All Notifications Read, and Get Subscription Status requests.
- **docker-compose.yml:** Fixed build context (`./backend`) and volume mount (`./backend/instance`) to match lowercase directory name after rename.

### Changed

- **Documentation:** `docs/development/LocalDevelopment.md` and `docs/architecture/ServerArchitecture.md` updated to reflect lowercase `backend/` directory and `administration-tool/` frontend service name.

---

## [0.0.22] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- **Forum MVP strengthened:** 27 passing tests cover category visibility, thread/post creation, permissions, like/unlike, reports, moderation actions (lock/unlock, pin/unpin, hide/unhide), counter consistency, and search behavior.
- **News management DX hardened:** Local development documentation and refined article management flow.
- **Discussion integration:** Added `discussion_thread_id` field to NewsArticle and WikiPage models. New endpoints: POST/DELETE `/api/v1/news/<id>/discussion-thread` and `/api/v1/wiki/<id>/discussion-thread` to link/unlink discussion threads with news and wiki content.
- **Subscription foundation:** New endpoint GET `/api/v1/forum/threads/<id>/subscribers` (moderator/admin only) to list thread subscribers.
- **Moderation metrics:** Lightweight endpoints GET `/api/v1/forum/moderation/metrics` and GET `/api/v1/forum/moderation/recent-reports` for moderation dashboard.
- **Notification foundation:** Basic Notification model with `event_type`, `target_type/id`, `is_read` tracking. Endpoint GET `/api/v1/notifications` for user to list their notifications (paginated, can filter unread only).
- **Postman collection:** Updated with all new endpoints (discussion links, subscriptions, moderation, notifications).

---

## [0.0.21] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- **Postman collection:** Updated `postman/WorldOfShadows_API.postman_collection.json` with forum module endpoints (categories, threads, posts, likes, reports).

---

## [0.0.20] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- **Forum QA repairs & expanded tests:** Comprehensive test framework for forum module with 27 tests covering category visibility, thread/post creation, permissions, like/unlike functionality, report submissions, moderation actions (lock/unlock, pin/unpin, hide/unhide), own post editing/deletion, counter consistency, parent post validation, and search behavior. Tests verify role-based access control, soft-delete semantics, and permission enforcement.
- **Forum API enrichment:** Fixed API responses to include `author_username` field consistently across all forum endpoints (category thread listings, thread creation/update, post creation, post listings, search results). Enriched like/unlike endpoints to return `liked_by_me` flag and updated post counts.
- **Forum moderation verification:** Confirmed full moderation UI implementation in both public (`/forum/threads/<slug>`) and management (`/manage/forum`) areas: lock/unlock, pin/unpin, hide/unhide for posts, category CRUD (admin-only), and report status management (open/reviewed/resolved/dismissed).

### Changed

- **Test coverage strategy:** Forum module now has dedicated test suite in `Backend/tests/test_forum_api.py` with 27 comprehensive tests. Global repository coverage remains at pytest.ini gate of 85%; forum-specific tests demonstrate correct functionality independent of full repo coverage, allowing incremental improvements to broader test suite without blocking forum QA.

### Fixed

- **API serialization:** Author usernames now included in all thread responses (list, create, update, search) and post responses (list, create), enabling consistent user attribution in forum UI without additional API calls.
- **Test consistency:** Fixed test fixture patterns for proper SQLAlchemy session handling (category_id must be set before thread add, thread_id before post add) to prevent constraint violations.

---

## [0.0.19] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- **Forum architecture contracts:** Documented forum module boundaries, entities (categories, threads, posts, likes, reports, subscriptions), role behavior (public, user, moderator, admin), soft-delete semantics, slug strategy, pagination/search expectations, moderation rules, and high-level API contracts in `Backend/docs/FORUM_MODULE.md` to guide the implementation.
- **Forum schema and migrations:** Added persistent tables for `forum_categories`, `forum_threads`, `forum_posts`, `forum_post_likes`, `forum_reports`, and `forum_thread_subscriptions` via Alembic migration `021_forum_models`, with SQLite-safe, idempotent behavior and optional foreign key for `forum_threads.last_post_id`.
- **Forum service layer:** Implemented `forum_service` with role/permission helpers (access/create/post/edit/like/moderate), thread/post operations (create, update, soft-delete, hide/unhide, lock/unlock, pin/unpin, featured), reply/view/like counters, report CRUD helpers, and subscription helpers as the backend foundation for forum APIs and UI.
- **Forum API (v1):** Added `/api/v1/forum/*` endpoints for public category/thread/post listing and search, authenticated thread/post CRUD, likes, subscriptions, and reports, plus moderator/admin actions for locking/pinning/featuring/hiding content and full report/category management, all wired to the forum service and existing activity log and JWT/role enforcement.
- **Forum public frontend (Phase 3):** Public forum pages under `/forum`: categories list, category thread list with pagination and “New thread” modal, thread detail with paginated posts and reply form. Uses `FrontendConfig.apiFetch` and optional `ManageAuth.apiFetchWithAuth` for authenticated reads/writes; login hint and link to Manage login when not logged in. Nav link “Forum” in main header; forum styles and view-count increment on thread GET in backend.
- **Forum moderation/admin frontend (Phase 4):** Management UI under `/manage/forum` with a **Categories** card (lists categories via API, admin-only create/update/delete wired to `/api/v1/forum/admin/categories[...]`) and a **Reports** card (lists forum reports and allows moderators/admins to set status to open/reviewed/resolved/dismissed via `/api/v1/forum/reports[...]`). New feature flag `manage.forum` in `feature_registry` controls nav visibility; all actions use `ManageAuth.apiFetchWithAuth` and respect backend role checks (moderator/admin) and activity logging.
- **Forum critical fixes & tests:** Hardened thread listing so hidden/archived/private threads do not leak in category lists; tightened like permissions to require actual post visibility; added parent_post_id validation (existence, same-thread, depth, status); ensured reply counters and last-post metadata stay consistent after hide/unhide/delete; introduced `tests/test_forum_api.py` covering visibility, parent validation, like restrictions, and counter behavior.
- **Forum public UI (Phase C):** Like/Unlike buttons per post with `liked_by_me` and `author_username` in API; report modal (POST reports) on thread page; edit/delete own posts (PUT/DELETE) with inline edit; clearer empty/error states; `apiPut`/`apiDelete` and report form in `forum.js`; backend adds `author_username` and `liked_by_me` to thread and post responses; `current_user_is_moderator()` in permissions.
- **Forum moderation/admin UI (Phase D):** Lock/Unlock and Pin/Unpin on public thread page for moderators/admins; Hide/Unhide per post with `include_hidden` for mods; manage/forum shows category CRUD only for admins (moderators see only Reports); report review actions already present in manage UI.
- **Forum search & hardening (Phase E):** Public forum search on index page: form and results with pagination calling `GET /api/v1/forum/search`; search respects visibility (no leakage); CSS for search, mod bar, and hidden badge.

---

## [0.0.18] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- **Versioned data export/import:** Structured JSON export format with `metadata` (format_version, application_version, schema_revision, exported_at, scope, tables, generator, checksum) and `data.tables` for rows. Supports full database, single-table, and row-level exports.
- **Export/import services:** `app.services.data_export_service` and `app.services.data_import_service` implement export logic, metadata generation, import validation, schema/version checks, and deterministic all-or-nothing import execution.
- **Data-tool CLI:** `data-tool/data_tool.py` provides `inspect`, `validate`, and `transform` commands for export payloads. Validates metadata and data structure, optionally compares against a provided current schema revision, and can write sanitized copies for supported formats.
- **Admin data API:** `POST /api/v1/data/export`, `POST /api/v1/data/import/preflight`, `POST /api/v1/data/import/execute`. Export requires admin + feature `manage.data_export`; preflight requires admin + `manage.data_import`; execute requires **SuperAdmin** + `manage.data_import`. All endpoints enforce role/role_level/area-based permissions server-side.
- **Admin frontend UI:** New **Data** page under Manage (`/manage/data`) with export (scope/table/rows) and import (preflight + execute) flows wired to the real API; nav entry visible only when the user has `manage.data_export` in `allowed_features`.
- **Tests:** `tests/test_data_api.py` covering auth protection, export metadata, table validation, metadata/format/schema validation, SuperAdmin requirement, and primary-key collision handling. Full backend suite (203 tests) passes with the new features.
- **Docs & Postman:** `Backend/docs/DATA_EXPORT_IMPORT.md` documents format, metadata, validation, collision strategy, data-tool usage, and security model; Postman collection extended with a **Data Export/Import** folder (Export Full/Table/Rows, Import Preflight/Execute).

### Collision / import strategy

- **Primary key collisions:** For single-column PK tables, existing rows with the same primary keys are detected during preflight with `PRIMARY_KEY_CONFLICT`. Policy: **fail on conflict** – imports do not upsert or skip; they abort without any changes if conflicts exist.
- **Unsupported versions:** Payloads with `metadata.format_version` != 1 are rejected; schema mismatches are reported via `SCHEMA_MISMATCH` and should be resolved with the data-tool once transformation rules exist.

---

## [0.0.17] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- **Area-based access control:** Access to admin/dashboard features now depends on **Role**, **RoleLevel**, and **RoleAreas**. A user may use a feature only if role permits, role_level hierarchy permits, and (when the feature has area assignments) the user has the "all" area or at least one assigned area for that feature.
- **Area model:** Persistent `areas` table (id, name, slug, description, is_system, timestamps). Default areas seeded: `all`, `community`, `website content`, `rules and system`, `ai integration`, `game`, `wiki`. **`all`** is the special wildcard (global access). Areas manageable by admins; system areas protected where appropriate.
- **User–area relation:** Many-to-many via `user_areas`. Users can be assigned one or many areas; "all" grants access to all area-scoped features. API exposes `area_ids` and `areas` on user; admin can assign/remove user areas (subject to hierarchy: target must have lower role_level).
- **Feature/view–area mapping:** Table `feature_areas` (feature_id, area_id). Central registry in `feature_registry.py` with stable feature IDs (e.g. `manage.news`, `manage.users`, `manage.areas`, `manage.feature_areas`). Empty mapping = feature is global; otherwise only users with "all" or one of the assigned areas can access (in addition to role/level).
- **API:** `GET/POST /api/v1/areas`, `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/v1/areas/<id>`; `GET/PUT /api/v1/users/<id>/areas` (body: `area_ids`); `GET /api/v1/feature-areas`, `GET/PUT /api/v1/feature-areas/<feature_id>`. All admin-only; user areas enforce hierarchy. Auth/me includes `allowed_features` and `area_ids`/`areas`.
- **Admin frontend:** **Areas** page (list, create, edit, delete); **Feature access** page (list features, edit area assignment per feature); **Users** form: Areas multi-select and "Save areas". Nav links (News, Users, Roles, Areas, Feature access, Wiki, Slogans) shown/hidden by `allowed_features`.
- **Backend enforcement:** `require_feature(feature_id)` and `user_can_access_feature(user, feature_id)`; area and user-area and feature-area routes protected; user management requires feature `manage.users` and hierarchy.
- **Tests:** `test_areas_api.py` (areas CRUD, user areas GET/PUT, feature-areas list/put, auth/me allowed_features); conftest calls `ensure_areas_seeded()`; `test_home_returns_200` fixed for current landing content (WORLD OF SHADOWS / BLACKVEIN).
- **Docs:** `Backend/docs/AREA_ACCESS_CONTROL.md` (area model, defaults, "all", user/feature areas, API, frontend, hierarchy); `ROLE_HIERARCHY.md` updated with reference to area-based access.
- **Postman:** Collection variables `area_id`; folders **Areas** (List, Get, Create, Update, User Areas Get/Put) and **Feature Areas** (List, Get, Put).

### Changed

- **Permissions:** Role + RoleLevel + RoleAreas; centralized in `feature_registry` and `permissions`. No frontend-only checks for security; backend enforces feature and hierarchy on all admin actions.
- **Migrations:** 019 adds `areas` and `user_areas` and seeds default areas; 020 adds `feature_areas`. Seed/init-db runs `ensure_areas_seeded()`.

---

## [0.0.16] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- **Role QA:** New role `qa` added; seeded with default_role_level 5. Users can be assigned the QA role.
- **RoleLevel on users:** Users have a persistent `role_level` (integer). Stored in DB (migration 017), exposed in user API and dashboards. Used for strict hierarchy.
- **SuperAdmin:** Admin with `role_level >= 100` is SuperAdmin (semantic label only). Only SuperAdmin may increase their own role_level. All users start at role_level 0; create the initial SuperAdmin with `flask seed-dev-user --username admin --password Admin123 --superadmin` or `flask seed-admin-user`.
- **Role model extended:** Roles support optional `description` and `default_role_level` (metadata only; user role_level is not set from this). Seed sets defaults for roles; user authority (role_level) is always 0 except when created by seed.
- **Hierarchy enforcement (backend):** Admins may only edit/ban/unban/delete users with **strictly lower** role_level. Admins may not assign a role whose default_role_level is >= their own. Non-SuperAdmin cannot set own role_level; SuperAdmin may set own role_level only to >= 100. All enforced in user_routes and permissions.
- **Admin role management (frontend):** New **Roles** page under Manage: list roles, create, edit (name, description, default_role_level), delete. Role dropdown in Users is loaded from API (includes QA).
- **User management (frontend):** Users table shows **Level** (role_level). User form has **Role level** field; Save/Ban/Unban/Delete disabled when target has equal or higher role_level. Clear message when editing is forbidden.
- **Tests:** Hierarchy tests: admin cannot edit equal/higher level; cannot delete/ban higher; non-SuperAdmin cannot raise own level; SuperAdmin may raise own level. User list includes role_level. Fixtures: super_admin_user (level 100), admin_user_same_level (50).
- **CLI:** `flask set-user-role-level --username <name>` (bzw. `python -m flask set-user-role-level --username <name>`) setzt für einen bestehenden User das `role_level` (Standard 100 = SuperAdmin). Option `--role-level` für anderen Wert. Kein DEV_SECRETS_OK nötig; nützlich um bestehende Admins zu SuperAdmins zu machen.

### Changed

- **API:** User list/detail include `role_id` and `role_level`. PUT `/api/v1/users/<id>` accepts optional `role_level` (subject to hierarchy). Role create/update accept `description`, `default_role_level`.
- **Permissions:** `admin_may_edit_target`, `admin_may_assign_role_level`, `admin_may_assign_role_with_level`; `current_user_role_level`, `current_user_is_super_admin`. ALLOWED_ROLES includes `qa`.
- **Migrations:** 017 adds `roles.description`, `roles.default_role_level`, `users.role_level`; seeds QA. 018 sets all users’ `role_level` to 0 (authority is per-user; only seed creates SuperAdmin).

---

## [0.0.15] - 2026-03-11

### Added

- **User data: Created and Last seen:** User API and dashboards now expose `created_at` and `last_seen_at` (ISO 8601). `User.to_dict()` includes both; list and detail endpoints return them.
- **Backend dashboard – User Settings:** Profile section shows read-only **Created** and **Last seen** (UTC) for the current user.
- **Frontend manage users:** Users table has **Created** and **Last seen** columns; user detail form shows **Created** and **Last seen** (locale-formatted).
- **Landing teaser slogans with rotation:** Slogans with placement `landing.teaser.primary` are shown on both Backend and Frontend landing pages in the hero subtitle (replacing the static “Where power is automated…” / “A dark foundation…” text). When multiple slogans exist and rotation is enabled in Site Settings, they alternate at the configured interval.
- **Public site APIs:** `GET /api/v1/site/slogans?placement=&lang=` returns all slogans for a placement (for rotation); `GET /api/v1/site/settings` returns read-only `slogan_rotation_interval_seconds` and `slogan_rotation_enabled`. Both are public (no auth).
- **Postman:** Site collection extended with **Site Slogans (list for placement)** and **Site Settings (public)** requests.
- **Tests:** `test_slogans.py` extended with tests for `site/slogans` (public, requires placement, response structure, create-then-list, deactivate-excluded, multiple slogans) and `site/settings` (public, rotation fields).

### Changed

- **API:** `GET /api/v1/users` and `GET /api/v1/users/<id>` responses now include `created_at` and `last_seen_at`.
- **Landing pages:** Backend `home.html` and Frontend `index.html` load teaser slogans via the new slogans API and optional rotation (interval and enabled from site settings).

---

## [0.0.14] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed (frontend only)

- **Management frontend script order:** Page-specific scripts (users, news, wiki, slogans, login, dashboard) were included inside `{% block content %}`, so they ran before `manage_auth.js`. As a result, `ManageAuth` was undefined and pages failed silently. All page scripts are now in `{% block extra_scripts %}` so they run after the shared auth bootstrap.
- **Management page initialization:** Page modules no longer bail out at parse time with `if (!api) return`. They initialize on `DOMContentLoaded` (or immediately if already loaded), resolve `ManageAuth.apiFetchWithAuth` at init time, and set an `apiRef` used by all handlers. If auth is missing, the module logs to the console and shows an inline “Auth not loaded. Refresh the page.” message instead of failing silently.
- **Users page search:** Search input now triggers list reload on Enter in addition to the Apply button.
- **Frontend API config:** Default `BACKEND_API_URL` is again `http://127.0.0.1:5000` so local development works without env override. Set `BACKEND_API_URL` in the environment for deployment.

### Changed (frontend only)

- **Management UI states:** Loading, empty, and error states are surfaced; failed requests show messages in the UI; save/action buttons disable during in-flight requests where applicable.
- **Management hover/focus styling:** Nav links, table rows, tabs, and wiki page links use subtle hover (background/color) and distinct `focus-visible` outlines for accessibility. No layout jump or heavy outline on hover.

### Added (frontend only)

- **Regression documentation:** `docs/frontend/ManagementFrontend.md` describes required script order (config → main.js → manage_auth.js → extra_scripts) and a manual verification checklist for the management area.

---

## [0.0.13] - 2026-03-11

### Added

- **Real dashboard metrics:** Admin Metrics view uses only real user data. Active Users = users with `last_seen_at` in the last 15 minutes; Registered, Verified, Banned totals from DB. Active Users Over Time and User Growth charts from `GET /dashboard/api/metrics?range=24h|7d|30d|12m` with hourly/daily/monthly bucketing. Chart scales derived from actual data maxima. Fake revenue, sessions, and conversion metrics removed.
- **User activity tracking:** `last_seen_at` on User (migration 014), updated on web login and on JWT API requests (throttled to at most once per 5 minutes). `created_at` added for user growth series.
- **Slogan system:** Slogans are a managed content type with CRUD API (`/api/v1/slogans`, moderator+). Placement resolution via `GET /api/v1/site/slogan?placement=&lang=` (public). Categories and placement keys for landing hero/teaser, promo, ad slots. Active/validity/pinned/priority rules; language fallback to default.
- **Slogan management UI:** Frontend `/manage/slogans` for list, create, edit, delete, activate/deactivate. Landing teaser slogan is loaded dynamically from the API; fallback to static text when none or on error.
- **Site Management:** Admin dashboard section “Site Management” with slogan rotation settings: `slogan_rotation_interval_seconds` and `slogan_rotation_enabled` (persisted in `site_settings` table, migration 016).

### Changed

- **Dashboard Metrics UI:** Metric cards are Active Users (last 15 min), Registered Users, Verified Users, Banned Users. Revenue Trend replaced by Active Users Over Time; User Growth shows cumulative registered users. Range selector 24h / 7d / 30d / 12m. Threshold-alert panel for fake metrics removed.

---

## [0.0.12] - 2026-03-11

### Added

- **Wiki HTML sanitization:** Server-side allowlist sanitization (bleach) for all wiki markdown-rendered HTML. Script tags, event handlers, and `javascript:` URLs are removed. Public wiki API, legacy wiki GET, and backend `/wiki` route use sanitized output. Manage wiki preview uses DOMPurify only; when DOMPurify is unavailable, preview shows raw text (textContent) and never injects unsanitized HTML (weak regex fallback removed).
- **Dedicated password change endpoint:** `PUT /api/v1/users/<id>/password` (self only) with body `current_password` and `new_password`. Current password is required and validated before any change.
- **Security headers:** Backend and frontend set `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`, `Permissions-Policy`, and `Content-Security-Policy`. Optional `Strict-Transport-Security` when `ENFORCE_HTTPS` is set (backend).
- **CSP hardening:** Backend and frontend CSP include `object-src 'none'`. Frontend `connect-src` explicitly allows the backend API origin (derived from `BACKEND_API_URL`) so split frontend/backend setups (e.g. frontend :5001, backend :5000) can communicate. Regression test asserts backend CSP contains `object-src 'none'`.
- **CSV formula injection hardening:** Activity log CSV export uses `csv_safe_cell()` so cells starting with `=`, `+`, `-`, or `@` are prefixed and treated as text in spreadsheets.
- **Wiki slug uniqueness:** Unique constraint and service validation so slug is unique per language across all wiki pages. Migration 013. Duplicate slug in the same language returns a clear error.
- **Translation outdated handling:** When source (default-language) news article or wiki translation content is updated, other-language translations are marked outdated and `source_version` is set. Wiki: `upsert_wiki_page_translation` update path now sets `source_version` on the edited translation and marks all other languages for that page outdated (deterministic, regression-tested).
- **Regression tests:** `tests/test_security_and_correctness.py` for wiki sanitizer, password change (including missing current_password), generic user update rejecting password fields, news slug detail, CSV formula neutralization, security headers, wiki slug uniqueness, translation outdated marking, wiki update marking other translations outdated, verification/reset email not logging tokens or URLs. `tests/test_config.py`: secret-key required when not TESTING (including empty SECRET_KEY).

### Changed

- **Password not in generic user update:** Generic `PUT /api/v1/users/<id>` rejects requests that include `password` or `current_password` with 400 and a message to use `PUT /api/v1/users/<id>/password`. Password changes only via that dedicated endpoint (self, with current password).
- **Activation and reset links not logged:** In dev/TESTING mail fallback, verification and password-reset flows log that a link was sent but do not log the URL or token.
- **Frontend secret:** Frontend requires `SECRET_KEY` unless `FLASK_ENV=development` or `DEV_SECRETS_OK` is set; then a one-off random key is used and a warning is printed.

### Fixed

- **News detail by slug:** `get_news_by_slug` was missing from news route imports; `GET /api/v1/news/<slug>?lang=` now works; invalid slug returns 404.

---

## [0.0.11] - 2026-03-11

### Added

- **Documentation:** `docs/architecture/MultilingualArchitecture.md` – supported languages (de, en), default and fallback, translation statuses, roles, backend–n8n contract, public vs editorial routes.
- **User:** Field `preferred_language` (migration 010). Config `SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES`, `DEFAULT_LANGUAGE`. Module `app/i18n.py` for language validation and status constants.
- **News (new model):** Tables `news_articles` and `news_article_translations` (title, slug, summary, content, translation_status, etc.). Migration 011 with data migration from `news`, then drop of `news`. Public list/detail support `?lang=` and fallback; detail by id or slug.
- **Wiki (new model):** Tables `wiki_pages` and `wiki_page_translations` (key, slug, content_markdown, translation_status). Migration 012; seed from `Backend/content/wiki.md`. Backend `/wiki` serves from DB with file fallback. Public `GET /api/v1/wiki/<slug>?lang=`.
- **API – auth/users:** `GET /api/v1/auth/me` and user update expose `preferred_language`. `GET /api/v1/languages` (supported + default), `PUT /api/v1/users/<id>/preferences` (preferred_language). User update validates preferred_language.
- **API – news editorial:** `GET/PUT /api/v1/news/<id>/translations`, `GET/PUT .../translations/<lang>`, `POST .../submit-review`, `.../approve`, `.../publish`, `POST .../translations/auto-translate`. List with `include_drafts=1` returns `translation_statuses` and `default_language` per article.
- **API – wiki editorial:** `GET/POST/PUT /api/v1/wiki-admin/pages`, `GET/PUT .../pages/<id>/translations/<lang>`, `POST .../submit-review`, `.../approve`, `.../publish`, `POST .../translations/auto-translate`. Legacy `GET/PUT /api/v1/wiki` (file) unchanged.
- **n8n:** Config `N8N_WEBHOOK_URL`, `N8N_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `N8N_SERVICE_TOKEN`. On auto-translate (News/Wiki), backend POSTs webhook events `news.translation.requested` / `wiki.translation.requested` (article_id/page_id, target_language, source_language). Optional HMAC-SHA256 in `X-Webhook-Signature`. `app/n8n_trigger.py` for signing and sending.
- **n8n service auth:** Header `X-Service-Key` accepted on GET/PUT for news and wiki translations (alongside JWT). Service writes forced to `machine_draft`. Decorator `require_editor_or_n8n_service`. `docs/n8n/README.md` for setup, payloads, signature, idempotency.
- **Audit:** `log_activity` for translation actions submit-review, approve, publish (news and wiki).
- **Frontend – UI i18n:** `Frontend/translations/de.json` and `en.json`. Language resolution: `?lang=` → session → Accept-Language → default `de`. Context: `current_lang`, `t`, `frontend_config.currentLanguage`. Base template: nav, footer, skip-link, language switcher (DE/EN). News/wiki and manage use `t` for labels.
- **Frontend – public wiki:** Routes `/wiki` and `/wiki/<slug>`. Template `wiki_public.html` fetches `GET /api/v1/wiki/<slug>?lang=` and renders content.
- **Frontend – manage news (multilingual):** List with DE/EN status columns (badges); filters search, category, status, language, sort, direction. Editor: shared category/cover; language tabs (DE/EN) with title, slug, summary, content; Save, Request review, Approve, Publish translation, Publish article, Unpublish, Auto-translate, Delete. New article creates default-language translation.
- **Frontend – manage wiki (multilingual):** Page list, New page, select page loads translations. Language tabs DE/EN with markdown editor and preview; Save, Request review, Approve, Publish translation, Auto-translate.
- **Frontend – user admin:** Users table column Lang (`preferred_language`). Edit form: Preferred language (— default — / de / en); save via PUT. No password or hash fields.

### Changed

- **News:** Replaced single `news` table with `news_articles` + `news_article_translations`; public API uses `?lang=` and fallback.
- **Wiki:** Content from DB (`wiki_pages` + `wiki_page_translations`) with file fallback; public wiki API by slug and language.
- **Validation:** Language codes validated via `normalize_language` in routes and services; translation upserts one row per entity+language (no duplicates).

---

## [0.0.10] - 2026-03-11

### Added

- **Management area (Frontend):** Protected editorial and admin area at `/manage` (login at `/manage/login`). JWT-based auth: login form calls backend `POST /api/v1/auth/login`; token stored in `sessionStorage`; central `ManageAuth.apiFetchWithAuth()` attaches `Authorization: Bearer <token>` and redirects to login on 401. Current user bootstrapped via `GET /api/v1/auth/me`; username and role shown in header; logout clears token. Role-based nav: Users link visible only to admin.
- **News management UI:** `/manage/news` – list with pagination, search, category and published/draft filters, sort; row selection; create/edit form (title, slug, summary, content, category, cover_image, is_published); publish, unpublish, delete with confirmation; uses existing news API (list with `include_drafts=1` for staff, get/create/update/delete/publish/unpublish).
- **User administration UI:** `/manage/users` (admin only) – table with pagination and search; select row for detail panel; edit username, email, role (no password fields); ban (optional reason), unban, delete with confirmation. Uses `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/v1/users`, `PATCH .../role`, `POST .../ban`, `POST .../unban`.
- **Wiki editing:** Backend `GET /api/v1/wiki` and `PUT /api/v1/wiki` (moderator or admin). Read returns `{ content, html }` from `Backend/content/wiki.md`; write updates the file with optional activity logging. Frontend `/manage/wiki` – load source, textarea editor, client-side preview (marked.js), save; unsaved-changes handling. Public wiki view (`Backend /wiki`) unchanged.
- **Docs:** Management routes, frontend auth (sessionStorage, apiFetchWithAuth, /auth/me), and wiki API described in `docs/runbook.md` and `README.md` where relevant.

---

## [0.0.9] - 2026-03-11

Release 0.0.9 focuses on the new role and access-control model (user/moderator/admin), admin-only user management and bans, moderator/admin news permissions, blocked-user UX, and updated Postman and test coverage.

### Added

- **Wiki page:** Dedicated view at `/wiki`, reachable via the "Wiki" button in the header. Content is loaded from the Markdown file `Backend/content/wiki.md` and rendered to HTML with the Python `markdown` library (extension "extra"); if the file is missing, "Coming soon" is shown. New stylesheet `app/static/wiki.css` for wiki prose; template `wiki.html` extends `base.html`. Dependency `markdown>=3.5,<4` in `requirements.txt`. Test: `test_wiki_returns_200` in `test_web.py`.
- **Startup mode log:** On backend startup, a single line is always logged indicating the current mode: `Running BLACKVEIN Backend [mode: TESTING]`, `[mode: NORMAL (MAIL_ENABLED=1)]`, or `[mode: DEV (MAIL_ENABLED=0)]` (`app/__init__.py`).

### Changed

- **Email verification (dev):** When `MAIL_ENABLED=0` or `TESTING=True`, the activation link is logged at WARNING level on register/resend ("DEV email verification mode (...). Activation URL for 'user': ...") so it appears in the same terminal as HTTP logs (`app/services/mail_service.py`).

---

## [0.0.8] - 2025-03-10

### Added

- **User CRUD API:** Full CRUD for users at `/api/v1/users`: `GET /api/v1/users` (list, admin only, paginated with `page`, `limit`, `q`), `GET /api/v1/users/<id>` (single user, admin or self), `PUT /api/v1/users/<id>` (update, admin or self; body: optional `username`, `email`, `password`, `current_password`, `role` admin only), `DELETE /api/v1/users/<id>` (admin only). Service layer: `get_user_by_id`, `list_users`, `update_user`, `delete_user` in `user_service.py`; permissions `get_current_user()` and `current_user_is_admin()` in `app.auth.permissions`. On delete: user's news keep `author_id=None`; reset and verification tokens are removed.
- **User model:** `to_dict(include_email=False)` extended; auth responses (login, me) include `email` for the current user when requested.
- **BackendApi.md:** Section **4. Users (CRUD)** with all endpoints, query/body parameters and response formats; section 5 (General) renumbered.
- **Postman:** "Users" folder in the collection: Users List (admin), Users Get (self), Users Update (self), Users Get (404), Users Delete (admin, uses `target_user_id`). Variable `target_user_id` in collection and environments; Users List sets it to another user for Delete. `postman/README.md` and collection description updated for users and admin usage.
- **Runbook:** All commands documented in **two forms** (short `flask` / Python form `python -m flask`) and for **PowerShell** as well as **Bash/Terminal**. Table "Further useful commands" (migrations, stamp, seed-dev-user, seed-news, pytest). API flow with curl examples for Bash and PowerShell. Troubleshooting: `&&` in PowerShell, `flask` not found ? `python -m flask`.

### Changed

- **Config:** `MAIL_USE_TLS` default changed from `True` to `False` (local SMTP without TLS).
- **Auth API:** Login and Me responses include `email` for the logged-in user.

---

## [0.0.7] - 2025-03-10

### Added

- **Email verification on registration:** New users must verify their email before they can log in (web session and API JWT). After registration (web and API), a time-limited activation token is created and a verification email is sent (or only logged in dev when MAIL_ENABLED is off). Activation URL: `/activate/<token>`; validity configurable via `EMAIL_VERIFICATION_TTL_HOURS` (default 24).
- **User model:** Column `email_verified_at` (nullable DateTime); migration `005_add_email_verified_at`.
- **EmailVerificationToken:** New model and table `email_verification_tokens` (token_hash, user_id, created_at, expires_at, used_at, invalidated_at, purpose, sent_to_email); migration `006_email_verification_tokens`. Token creation as with password reset (secrets.token_urlsafe(32), SHA-256 hash).
- **Service layer:** `create_email_verification_token`, `invalidate_existing_verification_tokens`, `get_valid_verification_token`, `verify_email_with_token` in `user_service.py`. `send_verification_email` in `mail_service.py` (uses `APP_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` or url_for for activation link; when MAIL_ENABLED=False or TESTING, only logs).
- **Web registration:** After successful registration, redirect to `/register/pending` with instructions to check email; token is created and verification email sent.
- **New web routes:** `GET /register/pending`, `GET /activate/<token>`, `GET/POST /resend-verification` (generic success message, no user enumeration; existing tokens invalidated). Templates: `register_pending.html`, `resend_verification.html`.
- **Login enforcement:** Web login and `require_web_login`: users with email but no `email_verified_at` cannot log in (session not set or cleared, flash message). API `POST /auth/login`: for unverified email returns 403 with `{"error": "Email not verified."}`.
- **Config:** `MAIL_ENABLED`, `MAIL_USE_SSL`, `APP_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`, `EMAIL_VERIFICATION_TTL_HOURS` in `app/config.py`. Existing mail config (MAIL_SERVER, MAIL_PORT, etc.) unchanged.
- **Tests:** `test_register_post_success_redirects_to_pending`, `test_register_pending_get_returns_200`, `test_activate_valid_token_redirects_to_login`, `test_login_blocked_for_unverified_user`, `test_resend_verification_get_returns_200`, `test_login_unverified_email_returns_403`. Fixture `test_user_with_email` sets `email_verified_at` so reset/login tests keep working. Audit doc `Backend/docs/PHASE1_AUDIT_0.0.7.md`.
- **Postman:** Full test environment and test suite: two environments ("World of Shadows ? Local", "World of Shadows ? Test") with `baseUrl`, `apiPath`, `username`, `password`, `email`, `access_token`, `user_id`, `news_id`, `register_username`, `register_email`, `register_password`. Collection with test scripts for all requests: Auth (Register, Login, Login invalid, Me, Me no token), System (Health, Test Protected), News (List, Detail, Detail 404). Assertions for status codes and response body; Login sets token and `user_id`, News List sets `news_id`. `postman/README.md` with instructions (import, variables, Collection Runner).

### Changed

- **Registration (web):** Redirect after success changed from login to `/register/pending`.
- **Registration (API):** After `create_user`, verification tokens are created and email sent; login remains blocked with 403 until verification.

---

## [0.0.6] - 2025-03-10

### Added

- **Developer workflow and documentation:** `docker-compose.yml` updated for the Frontend/Backend split: two services, `backend` (build from Backend/, port 8000, Gunicorn) and `frontend` (build from Frontend/, port 5001). Backend sets `CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5001,http://127.0.0.1:5001`; frontend sets `BACKEND_API_URL=http://localhost:8000` so the browser can call the API. `Frontend/requirements.txt` (Flask) and `Frontend/Dockerfile` added for the compose build. `README.md` rewritten: repository structure (Backend + Frontend), prerequisites, env vars (with table), **run workflow** (backend: `cd Backend`, `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `flask init-db`, `flask db upgrade`, optional `flask seed-dev-user` / `flask seed-news`, `python run.py` or `flask run`; frontend: `cd Frontend`, `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `python frontend_app.py`), **migrations** (`flask db upgrade` / `flask db revision` from Backend/), **tests** (`pytest` from Backend/), **Docker** (`docker compose up --build`, backend 8000, frontend 5001), and links to `docs/development/LocalDevelopment.md`, architecture, runbook, security, Backend tests README. No vague docs; commands and structure match the current repo.
- **Backend tests for news API and split:** New `Backend/tests/test_news_api.py` (19 tests): news list JSON shape and item fields; news detail JSON and 404 for missing/draft; search (q), sort (sort/direction), pagination (page/limit), category filter; published-only visibility (list excludes drafts, detail returns 404 for draft); anonymous write (POST/PUT/DELETE without token ? 401); authenticated user with role=user (POST/PUT ? 403); editor (role=editor) write (POST 201, PUT 200, publish 200, DELETE 200). Fixtures in `conftest.py`: `editor_user`, `editor_headers`, `sample_news` (two published, one draft). `Backend/tests/README.md` updated. News detail route fixed to handle timezone-naive `published_at` from SQLite (compare with UTC when needed). All 64 Backend tests pass; test paths remain under `Backend/tests/`.
- **Frontend?backend connectivity:** Backend API base URL is centralized: Frontend reads it only from `BACKEND_API_URL` (env) ? Flask `inject_config()` ? `window.__FRONTEND_CONFIG__.backendApiUrl`. `main.js` is loaded in `base.html` and exposes `FrontendConfig.getApiBaseUrl()` and `FrontendConfig.apiFetch(pathOrUrl, opts)`. `apiFetch` builds the full URL from the base + path, sends `Accept: application/json`, and returns a Promise that resolves with parsed JSON or rejects with an error message string (network, 4xx/5xx, or invalid JSON). News list and detail use `FrontendConfig` and `apiFetch` for all backend calls. CORS: when Frontend and Backend run on different origins (e.g. Frontend :5001, Backend :5000), set `CORS_ORIGINS=http://127.0.0.1:5001,http://localhost:5001` so the browser allows API requests; documented in `.env.example`. `docs/development/LocalDevelopment.md` describes default URLs (Backend 5000, Frontend 5001), startup flow, how Frontend and Backend talk (single API URL source, apiFetch, CORS), and optional seed commands.
- **Seed/example news:** `flask seed-news` (requires `DEV_SECRETS_OK=1`) creates a small set of example news entries for development and validation. Themes: project announcement, backend/frontend split (development), news system live (features), World of Blackveign (lore), API and CORS setup (technical), and one draft (Upcoming Events). Categories: Announcements, Development, Features, Lore, Technical. Five published and one draft so list/detail, search, sort, and category filter can be tested. Author is set from the first user if any. Skips slugs that already exist. Data is loaded by running the CLI once after `flask init-db` (and optionally `flask seed-dev-user`).
- **Frontend news detail page:** `Frontend/templates/news_detail.html` and `Frontend/static/news.js` (loadDetail) implement the public article view. Page is directly addressable at `/news/<id>`; JS fetches `GET /api/v1/news/<id>` and renders title, date (published_at/created_at), summary (if present), full content, author and category in meta line, and back link to news list. No placeholder content; loading and error states only. Document title updates to "Article title ? World of Shadows" when the article loads. Styling: `.news-detail-content .summary`, `.back-link-top`/`.back-link-bottom`, focus-visible on back link.
- **Frontend news list page:** `Frontend/templates/news.html` and `Frontend/static/news.js` implement the public news list with backend API consumption only (no DB). List shows title, summary, published date, category, and link to detail. Controls: search (q), sort (published_at, created_at, updated_at, title), direction (asc/desc), category filter, Apply button; Enter in search/category triggers apply. Pagination: Previous/Next and "Page X of Y (total)"; hidden when a single page. States: loading, empty ("No news yet"), error. Styling in `styles.css`: `.news-controls`, `.news-input`, `.news-select`, `.news-item-summary`, `.news-item-meta`, `.news-pagination`; WoS design tokens. Entry point: `NewsApp.initList()`.
- **Public frontend base and homepage:** `Frontend/templates/base.html` is the common public layout with semantic header (nav: News, Wiki, Community, Log in, Register, Dashboard), skip-link for accessibility, main content area, and footer. `Frontend/templates/index.html` is the public homepage with hero (Blackveign tagline, Get started / Sign in / News CTAs) and an "Explore" card grid linking to News, Log in, Register, and Dashboard. All auth/dashboard links point to the backend (`BACKEND_API_URL`). `Frontend/static/styles.css` includes World of Shadows design tokens (void/violet, Inter, JetBrains Mono), header/nav/footer styles, hero and card grid, focus-visible for keyboard users, and styles shared with news pages. `Frontend/static/main.js` exposes `FrontendConfig.getApiBaseUrl()` for API consumption. No server-side DB; frontend is static/JS-driven and production-oriented.
- **Permission groundwork for news write:** User model has a `role` column (`user`, `editor`, `admin`). Only `editor` and `admin` may call the protected news write API (POST/PUT/DELETE/publish/unpublish); others receive 403 Forbidden. Helper `current_user_can_write_news()` in `app.auth.permissions` and `User.can_write_news()` centralise the check; news write routes use the helper after `@jwt_required()`. Migration `004_add_user_role` adds `role` with server default `editor` for existing users; new registrations get `user`; `flask seed-dev-user` creates users with `editor` so dev can write news.
- **News service layer:** `Backend/app/services/news_service.py` with `list_news` (published_only, search, sort, order, page, per_page, category), `get_news_by_id`, `get_news_by_slug`, `create_news`, `update_news`, `delete_news`, `publish_news`, `unpublish_news`. Filtering, sorting, pagination, and slug validation live in the service; route handlers stay thin. Exported from `app.services`.
- **Public news API:** `GET /api/v1/news` (list) and `GET /api/v1/news/<id>` (detail). List supports query params: `q` (search), `sort`, `direction`, `page`, `limit`, `category`. Only published news is returned; drafts/unpublished return 404 on detail. Response: list `{ "items", "total", "page", "per_page" }`, detail single news object. Uses news service; rate limit 60/min.
- **Protected news write API:** `POST /api/v1/news`, `PUT /api/v1/news/<id>`, `DELETE /api/v1/news/<id>`, `POST /api/v1/news/<id>/publish`, `POST /api/v1/news/<id>/unpublish`. All require `Authorization: Bearer <JWT>` and editor/admin role; 401 without or invalid token, 403 for forbidden. Author for create set from JWT identity. Handlers delegate to news_service; rate limit 30/min per write endpoint.

---

## [0.0.5] - 2025-03-10

### Added

- **Architecture audit:** Implementation note `docs/architecture/FrontendBackendRestructure.md` defining the target Backend/Frontend split. World of Shadows is to be restructured into `Backend/` (app, instance, migrations, tests, run.py, API, auth, dashboard) and `Frontend/` (frontend_app.py, public templates, static, API consumption). MasterBlogAPI used only as reference for separation and API-first content delivery; existing auth and branding preserved. Real news system will be implemented in Backend (model + API) with frontend consuming JSON; no file moves in this audit step.
- **Backend/Frontend restructure:** Repository split into `Backend/` and `Frontend/`. Backend now contains `app/`, `migrations/`, `tests/`, `run.py`, `requirements.txt`, `requirements-dev.txt`, `Dockerfile`, `pytest.ini`, `.dockerignore`; run and test from `Backend/` with `FLASK_APP=run:app`. New `Frontend/` has `frontend_app.py`, `templates/`, `static/` (placeholder only). Root keeps `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `docker-compose.yml`, `docs/`, `.env.example`. Docker build context is `Backend/`; compose mounts `Backend/instance`. No news system yet; structure only.
- **Frontend application:** Lightweight Flask public frontend in `Frontend/`: `frontend_app.py` with home (`/`), news list (`/news`), news detail (`/news/<id>`); templates `base.html`, `index.html`, `news.html`, `news_detail.html`; static `styles.css`, `main.js`, `news.js`. Config via `BACKEND_API_URL` (default `http://127.0.0.1:5000`) for login/wiki/community links and for JS to call backend API. No database; news data will be loaded by JS from backend API (graceful empty/404 until news API exists). Styling aligned with World of Shadows (void/violet, Inter, JetBrains Mono). Run from `Frontend/` with `python frontend_app.py` (port 5001).
- **News model:** `Backend/app/models/news.py` with id, title, slug (unique), summary, content, author_id (FK users), is_published, published_at, created_at, updated_at, cover_image, category; migration `003_news` adds `news` table.

### Changed

- **Routing responsibility split:** Backend serves only auth and internal flows (login, register, forgot/reset-password, dashboard, game-menu, wiki/community placeholders). When `FRONTEND_URL` is set, backend redirects `GET /` and `GET /news` to the frontend so the public home and news are served only by the frontend; logout redirects to frontend home. Backend keeps legacy `home.html`/`news.html` when `FRONTEND_URL` is unset (e.g. tests, backend-only deployment). No duplicate public news; config documented in `.env.example` and `docs/architecture/FrontendBackendRestructure.md`.
- **Backend stabilization (post-move):** When running from `Backend/`, config now also loads `.env` from repo root so a single `.env` at project root works. Documented that the database instance path is `Backend/instance` when run from Backend. Imports, migration path, pytest discovery, and Docker/startup unchanged and verified; all 45 tests pass from `Backend/`.
- **Config:** Single `TestingConfig`; removed duplicate. `FRONTEND_URL` (optional) for redirecting public home/news to frontend.

### Security

- **Open redirect:** Login no longer redirects to external URLs. `is_safe_redirect()` in `app/web/auth.py` allows only path-only URLs (no scheme, no netloc). `next` query param is ignored when unsafe; fallback to dashboard.

---

## [0.0.4] - 2025-03-10

### Added

- **Landing page:** Aetheris-style hero (eyebrow, title, subtitle, CTAs), benefits grid, scrolling ticker, features section, void footer, fixed command dock. Design tokens (void, violet, mono/display fonts, transitions) and Google Fonts (Inter, JetBrains Mono). `landing.js`: hero cursor shear, feature reveal on scroll, benefit counters, smooth scroll for dock links, preload with IntersectionObserver; reduced-motion respected.
- **Dashboard:** Two-column layout (sidebar left, content right). Sidebar sections: User (User Settings), Admin (Overview, Metrics, Logs). User Settings: form for name and email with "Save Changes" (client-side confirmation). Metrics view: metric cards, revenue/user charts (Chart.js), threshold config with localStorage and breach alerts. Logs view: filterable activity table, CSV export. Overview: short description of sections. Content area fills available height with internal scroll.
- **Header navigation:** "Log in" removed. New nav links: News, Wiki, Community (each with placeholder page). When logged in: "Enter Game" between News and Wiki, linking to protected `/game-menu` (Game Menu placeholder page).
- **Base template:** Optional blocks for layout variants: `html_class`, `body_class`, `extra_head`, `site_header`, `site_main`, `flash_messages`, `content`, `site_footer`, `extra_scripts`. Header and footer kept by default; landing overrides only `site_main`.

### Changed

- **Config / styles:** Extended `:root` with violet/void tokens and font variables. Landing and dashboard CSS appended; responsive breakpoints for hero, benefits, features, dock and dashboard grid.

---

## [0.0.3] - 2025-03-10

### Security

- **Secrets:** Removed hardcoded fallback secrets from production config. `SECRET_KEY` and `JWT_SECRET_KEY` must be set in the environment. App raises at startup if `SECRET_KEY` is missing (unless testing or `DEV_SECRETS_OK=1`).
- **Dev-only fallback:** Added `DevelopmentConfig` and `DEV_SECRETS_OK` env var. When set, dev fallback secrets are used and `flask seed-dev-user` is allowed. Not for production.
- **Default user seeding removed:** `flask init-db` only creates tables; it no longer creates an admin/admin user. Use `flask seed-dev-user` with `DEV_SECRETS_OK=1` for local dev only.
- **Logout:** Web logout is POST only. Logout link replaced with a form and CSRF token to reduce abuse.
- **CSRF:** Web forms (login, logout) protected with CSRF. API blueprint exempt; API remains JWT-based.
- **CORS:** Origins are configurable via `CORS_ORIGINS` (comma-separated). No CORS when unset (same-origin only).
- **Session cookies:** `SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY` and `SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` set explicitly; `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` when `PREFER_HTTPS=1`.

### Added

- **Web auth:** Protected route `/dashboard`; central `require_web_login` decorator in `app/web/auth.py`. Anonymous access to `/dashboard` redirects to `/login`.
- **Login flow:** If already logged in, GET `/login` redirects to dashboard. Optional `next` query param for redirect-after-login.
- **Dashboard template:** `app/web/templates/dashboard.html`.
- **CLI:** `flask seed-dev-user` to create a default admin user when `DEV_SECRETS_OK=1`.
- **Documentation:** `README.md` (purpose, structure, setup, env, web/API usage). `docs/runbook.md` (local workflow, example API flow). `docs/security.md` (auth model, CSRF, CORS, cookies, dev-only behavior).

### Changed

- **Config:** `SECRET_KEY`, `JWT_SECRET_KEY` from env only in base config. Added `CORS_ORIGINS`, explicit session cookie settings. `DevelopmentConfig` and `TestingConfig` separated.
- **Startup:** Debug mode driven by `FLASK_DEBUG` instead of `FLASK_ENV`.
- **API:** User lookup uses `db.session.get(User, id)` (SQLAlchemy 2.x) instead of `User.query.get(id)`.
- **Web health:** Docstring aligned: returns JSON status.
- **.env.example:** Updated with required vars, `CORS_ORIGINS`, `FLASK_DEBUG`, `DEV_SECRETS_OK`.

### Removed

- **Default admin from init-db:** No automatic admin/admin creation.
- **Empty layer:** Removed unused `app/repositories/` package.

### Documentation

- README.md: project purpose, scope, structure, setup, environment table, web/API usage, limitations, links to runbook and security.
- docs/runbook.md: one-time setup, start server, web flow, API curl examples, health checks, troubleshooting.
- docs/security.md: session vs JWT auth, CSRF scope, secrets and dev fallback, default users, CORS, session cookies, rate limiting.

---

## [0.0.2] - 2025-03-10

### Added

- **Test suite:** Pytest tests for web and API (19 tests), in-memory DB config, pytest.ini, pytest and pytest-cov in requirements.
- **Planning docs:** Milestone list and execution prompts for staged rebuild (no code changes).

---

## [0.0.1] - 2025-03-10

### Added

- **Server foundation**
  - Flask application factory (`app/__init__.py`) with config loading from environment.
  - Central config (`app/config.py`) for `SECRET_KEY`, database URI, JWT, session cookies, and rate limiting.
  - Extensions module (`app/extensions.py`): SQLAlchemy, Flask-JWT-Extended, Flask-Limiter, Flask-CORS.

  - Templates: `base.html`, `home.html`, `login.html`, `404.html`, `500.html`.
  - Static assets: `app/static/style.css` (World of Shadows theme).

- **API (REST v1)**
  - Versioned API under `/api/v1`.
  - **Auth:** `POST /api/v1/auth/register`, `POST /api/v1/auth/login` (returns JWT), `GET /api/v1/auth/me` (protected).
  - **System:** `GET /api/v1/health`, `GET /api/v1/test/protected` (protected).
  - JWT authentication for API; CORS and rate limiting enabled.
  - Consistent JSON error responses for 401 and 429.

- **Tooling and docs:** requirements.txt, .env.example, Postman collection for API testing.

### Technical notes

- `.gitignore` updated (instance/, *.db, .env, __pycache__, etc.).
- Server foundation: Flask app factory, config, extensions (db, jwt, limiter, CORS), single entrypoint run.py.
- Database: SQLite default, User model, flask init-db.
- Web: Blueprint with home, health, login, logout; session auth; templates and static.
- API: /api/v1 health, auth (register, login, me), protected test route; JWT and rate limiting.
- Tooling and docs: requirements.txt, .env.example, Postman collection for API testing.
